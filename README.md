# Primo headless

This repo demonstrates how you can consume a Primo site's data from SvelteKit (or a similar framework). 

In this case, it's used to list blog posts and render individual blog posts. The content is server-side rendered or can be statically rendered from SvetleKit. 

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
